version: '1.0'
name: Purple_Team_Attack_Exercise
description: >
  A comprehensive Purple Team exercise for simulating DLL injection using 
  mimikatz payloads, exploiting PrintNightmare vulnerability, 
  and executing scareware (fake ransom notes).

components:
  - mimikatz_dll_injection:
      description: >
        Exploit DLL injection using mimikatz to escalate privileges and perform SYSTEM-level actions.
        Includes fileless execution (reflective injection).
      scripts:
        - mimikatz_loader.cpp
        - mimikatz_dll.cpp
        - mimikatz.h
        - mimikatz.hpp
      build_steps:
        - compile:
            commands:
              - "cl /EHsc /D_USRDLL /D_WINDLL mimikatz_dll.cpp /link /DLL /out:mimikatz.dll"
              - "cl /EHsc mimikatz_loader.cpp /link /out:mimikatz_loader.exe"
            dependencies:
              - Windows SDK
        - dependencies:
            - Wtsapi32.lib

        post_execution:
          - ShowFakeRansomNote: 
              message: "Your files have been encrypted. Send 0.5 BTC to the wallet address below: 1FakeBTCAddrXYZ999"
        notes:
          - Ensure mimikatz.dll is loaded via a reflective loader (using mimikatz_loader.exe).

  - printnightmare_exploitation:
      description: >
        Exploiting PrintNightmare vulnerability (CVE-2021-1675) to achieve privilege escalation.
        Inject mimikatz into the target system and leverage the SYSTEM token.
      methods:
        - exploit:
            vulnerability: PrintNightmare (CVE-2021-1675)
            technique: DLL Injection + Token Impersonation
            steps:
              - Use spooler service to trigger remote code execution via PrintNightmare.
              - Load mimikatz.dll payload using reflective injection or standard DLL injection methods.
        - dependencies:
            - Win32 API
            - WTS API
            - Userenv API
      payload:
        name: mimikatz_payload
        actions:
          - SYSTEM_shell_access: >
              Running command shells as SYSTEM on all active sessions.
          - privilege_escalation:
              method: SYSTEM token impersonation on active sessions.
          - automation:
              command: "CreateProcessAsUserW using SYSTEM token"

  - automation:
      description: >
        Automating the execution of the Purple Team exercise for training and simulation of offensive and defensive strategies.
      scripts:
        - deploy_attack:
            description: >
              Deploy mimikatz.dll injection and PrintNightmare exploitation to Windows hosts.
              Execute the payload and show scareware pop-up after successful exploitation.
            steps:
              - "Step 1: Inject mimikatz.dll into a target process using mimikatz_loader.exe"
              - "Step 2: Exploit PrintNightmare for SYSTEM-level access"
              - "Step 3: Show fake ransom message via MessageBoxA"
              - "Step 4: Verify SYSTEM shell access on target systems"
              - "Step 5: Clean up after execution (remove mimikatz.dll, stop backdoor processes)"

  - defensive_simulation:
      description: >
        Deploying detection mechanisms for Blue Team to spot the attack flow.
      components:
        - logging:
            action: "Log all fileless injection attempts and suspicious processes."
        - monitoring:
            method: "Monitor network traffic for abnormal print spooler activity."
        - alerting:
            system: "Trigger alerts for DLL injections and SYSTEM token impersonation attempts."

deployment:
  target_environment:
    description: >
      This exercise will be run on a controlled network with the following environment:
      - Windows 11 host machine
      - Disable Windows Defender / Anti-Virus for testing
      - Elevated privileges (admin or SYSTEM access for payload delivery)
  configuration:
    steps:
      - configure_exploit:
          - Enable PrintNightmare exploit
          - Ensure mimikatz DLL is accessible to the loader
          - Set up payload path for injection
      - configure_ransomware:
          - Trigger fake ransom note post-injection
          - Customize BTC wallet address (for realism)
      - execute_attack:
          - Run mimikatz_loader.exe to inject mimikatz.dll
          - Ensure DLL injection completion before executing scareware
      - post_attack_cleanup:
          - Delete all temporary files used for attack
          - Ensure no lingering system changes after attack

simulation:
  objective:
    - Test offensive techniques (DLL injection, PrintNightmare exploitation)
    - Practice defensive techniques (process monitoring, alerting)
    - Demonstrate real-world exploitation tactics in a controlled environment

  timeline:
    - Preparation:
        time: 1 hour
        description: >
          Setup Windows 11 environment, ensure all necessary tools and dependencies are in place, 
          disable security features temporarily, and configure the attack vector.
    - Attack Execution:
        time: 30 minutes
        description: >
          Deploy mimikatz DLL payload, trigger PrintNightmare exploit, and display scareware pop-up.
    - Defense Reaction:
        time: 1 hour
        description: >
          Blue Team responds by monitoring for anomalies, logging any suspicious activities, and
          identifying attack signatures using provided defensive tools.
    - Post-Exercise Analysis:
        time: 30 minutes
        description: >
          Discuss lessons learned, review defensive techniques, and fine-tune detection strategies.

  feedback:
    after_action_report:
      - attack_success:
          condition: "If payload is successfully executed with SYSTEM access and scareware displayed"
      - detection_success:
          condition: "If Blue Team detects and responds to the attack within the designated time"
