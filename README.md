# 🧠 Understanding **100% Fileless Malware**

**Fileless malware** is a highly evasive threat class designed to operate entirely in-memory, without touching the disk — making it exceptionally difficult to detect using traditional endpoint solutions.

---

## ❓ What Is Fileless Malware?

> **Fileless malware** executes malicious logic without dropping persistent binaries to the file system.

Instead, it:
- **Resides in memory (RAM)** throughout execution
- **Leverages native system tools** (e.g., `PowerShell`, `WMIC`, `rundll32`)
- **Reflectively injects** into legitimate processes (e.g., `explorer.exe`)
- **Executes via scripts, macros, or registry-stored payloads**

Because it avoids disk I/O, detection by conventional antivirus (which scans files, not behavior) is significantly reduced.

---

## ✅ Is 100% Fileless Malware Possible?

**Theoretically, yes.** Entire chains can be built with:
- Phishing-delivered **macros or scripts**
- In-memory **reflective DLL loading**
- Native binaries used as **LOLBins**
- **No custom executables** ever touching disk

**In practice**, most campaigns adopt **hybrid techniques**:
- Temporary staging files (deleted post-use)
- Registry-resident scripts
- Memory-resident payloads triggered by disk-based stubs

---

## 🔍 Why It Matters

- 📁 Traditional AV focuses on files, not **process memory or system behavior**
- 🧬 Fileless malware increases **stealth, dwell time, and forensic resistance**
- 🔍 Detection requires advanced **EDR**, **memory scanners**, or **behavior analytics**
