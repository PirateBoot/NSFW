Hereâ€™s a curated list of **LOLBins (Living Off the Land Binaries)** relevant to the fileless, Windows 11-compatible, and stealthy ransomware/wiperware killchain we just covered:

---

### ðŸ”¹ **Execution & Payload Delivery**
- `mshta.exe` â€“ Execute remote HTA/VBScript payloads.
- `rundll32.exe` â€“ Run DLLs and JavaScript-based COM objects in memory.
- `regsvr32.exe` â€“ Execute remote scripts/DLLs using scriptlet loading.
- `powershell.exe` â€“ Core script execution, fileless payload loading.
- `msiexec.exe` â€“ Install and execute remote MSI payloads.
- `cmd.exe` â€“ Generic script/command execution.
- `wscript.exe` / `cscript.exe` â€“ VBScript/JS-based execution.
- `certutil.exe` â€“ Download payloads or decode base64-encoded files.

---

### ðŸ”¹ **Persistence & Scheduled Execution**
- `schtasks.exe` â€“ Create scheduled tasks for persistence.
- `wmic.exe` â€“ Execute commands and lateral movement via WMI.
- `eventvwr.exe` â€“ UAC bypass via hijacked registry keys.
- `fodhelper.exe` â€“ UAC bypass via auto-elevated binary.

---

### ðŸ”¹ **Privilege Escalation & Credential Access**
- `dllhost.exe` â€“ DLL hijacking/COM hijacking.
- `slui.exe` â€“ Another UAC bypass vector.
- `sdclt.exe` â€“ Abused for arbitrary command execution and privilege escalation.
- `taskmgr.exe` â€“ Can load malicious DLLs when hijacked.

---

### ðŸ”¹ **Lateral Movement**
- `psexec.exe` â€“ Remote command execution (Red Team favorite).
- `winrm.vbs` â€“ PowerShell Remoting helper.
- `wmic.exe` â€“ Cross-network process creation via WMI.

---

### ðŸ”¹ **Impact â€“ Data Destruction / Anti-Forensics**
- `cipher.exe` â€“ Securely delete files and wipe disk space.
- `vssadmin.exe` â€“ Delete volume shadow copies (anti-backup).
- `wbadmin.exe` â€“ Delete backup catalogs.
- `bcdedit.exe` â€“ Disable recovery options.
- `wevtutil.exe` â€“ Clear event logs.
- `shutdown.exe` â€“ Reboot/shutdown system post-attack.
- `fsutil.exe` â€“ Manipulate file system behaviors or drive states.

This list contains **all essential LOLBins** that enable full-spectrum ransomware or wiperware simulationsâ€”from delivery and execution to lateral movement, data destruction, and stealthâ€”all while remaining fileless and evasive in a Windows 11 environment. Let me know if you want them exported as JSON, CSV, or mapped to ATT&CK IDs.
