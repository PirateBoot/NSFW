  title: "Fileless Wiperware (AES-XTS Encryption & Track-Covering)"
  description: "A simulated wiperware attack targeting Windows 11 with fileless operation, high-speed AES-XTS encryption, data destruction, and track-covering functionality."
  created_by: "APEX Q"
  date_created: "2025-04-16"
  scenario:
    - Red Team: "Simulate wiperware behavior, including encryption of target files, NTFS metadata wiping, and stealth operations."
    - Blue Team: "Monitor and respond to wiperware activity, detect abnormal behavior, and attempt remediation."

attack_goals:
  objectives:
    - "Perform data destruction on target files (documents, databases, media files, etc.)."
    - "Overwrite NTFS system files and metadata, such as $MFT, $Bitmap, and $LogFile."
    - "Encrypt files using AES-XTS encryption and mark them with a custom extension (.cucklocked)."
    - "Cover tracks by clearing Windows event logs, removing temporary files, and erasing registry keys associated with the attack."
    - "Ensure high-speed encryption with minimal observable impact on the system's performance."
    - "Operate filelessly, without leaving traditional disk footprints or easily detectable traces."
  
simulation_steps:
  - step: "Step 1 - Encrypt Target Files"
    description: |
      "The attacker scans through the user's directories, targeting files with specific extensions (.docx, .jpg, .pdf, .mp4, etc.). These files are encrypted using AES-XTS and renamed with the .cucklocked extension."
    objectives:
      - "Encrypt target files"
      - "Tag files with the '.cucklocked' extension"
    detection_tactics:
      - "File encryption detection"
      - "File rename monitoring"
      - "Unusual file access patterns"

  - step: "Step 2 - Wipe NTFS System Files"
    description: |
      "The wiperware will also target key NTFS metadata files, such as $MFT, $LogFile, and $Bitmap, and attempt to overwrite or corrupt these files."
    objectives:
      - "Overwrite NTFS system files"
    detection_tactics:
      - "File system integrity monitoring"
      - "Monitoring for access to critical system files"
      - "Unexpected file modifications"

  - step: "Step 3 - Cover Tracks"
    description: |
      "The attacker will then attempt to cover their tracks by clearing Windows event logs, removing temporary files, and deleting registry keys associated with the wiperware execution."
    objectives:
      - "Clear event logs (Security, System, Application)"
      - "Delete temporary files in the %TEMP% folder"
      - "Remove registry keys related to wiperware execution"
    detection_tactics:
      - "Log tampering detection"
      - "Registry changes monitoring"
      - "Temporary file deletion alerting"

monitoring_and_detection:
  detection_methods:
    - "File system integrity checks"
    - "Anomaly detection in event logs"
    - "File renaming or encryption alerts"
    - "Unusual process or memory behavior"
    - "Registry monitoring for unauthorized changes"
    - "Network traffic analysis (if applicable)"
  tools_to_use:
    - "Sysmon (System Monitor) for file creation and modification"
    - "Windows Event Log for abnormal event activity"
    - "Wireshark or similar network monitoring tools for detecting command and control (if needed)"
    - "Endpoint detection and response (EDR) tools"
    - "File Integrity Monitoring tools"

      description: "Monitor systems for signs of encrypted files or unusual access patterns."
    - action: "Restore NTFS metadata from backups"
      description: "If NTFS system files are targeted, recovery from backups may be necessary."
    - action: "Analyze and investigate event logs"
      description: "Examine event logs for signs of log tampering and determine if any wiperware activity was detected."
    - action: "Run memory analysis tools"
      description: "Memory forensics tools should be used to analyze for traces of malicious code or encryption keys in RAM."
    - action: "Respond to registry changes"
      description: "Investigate and reverse any registry changes made by the attacker."
